# Glitchless

Glitchless is the most popular of the five main categories, and is commonly regarded as more
beginner-friendly, as it doesn't require learning any complex glitches. Despite what the name suggests, there are
a lot of debates about what is and isn't allowed in glitchless, and the rules are subject to change.

There are a number of tricks that are still frequently debated, but are currently allowed in glitchless. It's normal
to be confused about what is and isn't allowed, so don't be afraid to ask in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/gQ285vS).
