# Inbounds

The inbounds category requires any props, the players camera, placed portals, and travelling portals to not leave the bounds
of the map. If any of these conditions are broken, you must reload a save to before the condition was broken. This category
relies heavily on save/load abuse and [ahop](/tricks/movement/ahop).

## Objective

Beat the game by any means necessary without making the players camera, any prop, placed portal, or travelling portals
leave the bounds of the map.

## Exceptions

Shooting a portal through OOB space that __doesn't land anywhere__, or accidentally doing clipping glitch in maps like 10,
are considered acceptable.
