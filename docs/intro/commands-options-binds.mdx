This page is going to be a reference for all the commands, options, and binds that are allowed and commonly utilized in
Portal speedrunning.

## Commands

This is a table of officially whitelisted commands, pulled from [SRDC](https://www.speedrun.com/portal/full_game?h=Out_of_Bounds-PC&rules=game&x=lvdowokp-kn0mz7ol.jq6nxjnl).

:::caution
Just because a command is whitelisted, does not clear it to be used in multi-binds on one key. Each category has it's own
list of rules you must follow, too.

All commands for the [Demo Record Plugin](/resources/demo-record-plugin#usage) are also whitelisted.

Whitelisted combination binds for glitch categories:
- `save <name>;load <name>;` - Used for [save glitch](/tricks/sg) and other things.
- `save <name>;fps_max <value>;load <name>` - Used for setting the max FPS convar and various glitches.

## Options

### FOV

Most Portal players use a higher FOV than the default 75. In order to change this, you can type `fov_desired <number>` into
the console. However, if you're playing on 3420, you'll need to [use a save to change your FOV](/resources/saves#wakeup_saves).

### DX95 vs DX80
Some Portal players use the launch option `-dxlevel 80` to run the game in DirectX 8.0 mode. This is typically done
for stylistic reasons, as the game looks less detailed and darker in DX80. This is a completely optional launch option, and
is not required for any category.

To enable DX80, simply add `-dxlevel 80` to your launch options. To disable it, remove it from your launch options. You
can change this launch option either in Steam by right-clicking Portal, clicking Properties, and typing it into the
Launch Options box, or if you're using [Source Unpack](/#source-unpack), add it to the `start` command in your `Portal.bat`
file. Then, after you launch the game, you should remove the option. It will stay, but if you leave the option there, it
will reset your settings every time you launch the game.

Below, you can see a comparison of DX95 and DX80, with DX80 on the left and DX95 on the right.

## Binds

Binds in Source Engine are used to bind a command to a key. For example, if you wanted to bind the command `+jump` to the
key `space`, you would type `bind space +jump` into the console. This would make it so that when you press space, you jump.

### save/load bind
`bind g save glitch;load glitch`

For most glitched categories, it is necessary to bind a key to saving and loading immediately after. This is used to
perform a large number of tricks, including [save glitch](/tricks/sg), [bsg](/tricks/bsg), and
various others.

### mouse scroll jump bind
`bind mwheelup +jump;bind mwheeldown +jump`

For nearly all categories, it is very helpful to bind jumping to scroll, as all main categories require a lot
of [bhop](/tricks/movement/bhop) and/or [ahop](/tricks/movement/ahop).

### toggle_duck
`bind r toggle_duck`

For categories that require [ahop](/tricks/movement/ahop), it is very helpful to bind toggle duck to a key.

## autoexec.cfg

`autoexec.cfg` is a file that is executed every time you launch Portal. This is a good place to put extra binds you want,
startup commands, and other things. To utilize this file, you will need to either locate or create the file `portal/cfg/autoexec.cfg`
in your Portal directory.

From there, you can add any commands you want to the file, separated by either `;` or a new line, and they will be run
when the game starts.
