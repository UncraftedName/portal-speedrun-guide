# Out of Bounds 13-18

These chambers have been combined due to similarity.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs queryString="tab" defaultValue="beginner" className="tabs tabs--block">
<TabItem value="beginner" label="Beginner" attributes={{className: "beginner"}}>

## Under Elevator 1

Easiest under elevator route that allows you to do chambers 13 to 18 very similarly.

<TabItem value="advanced" label="Advanced" attributes={{className: "advanced"}}>

## Under Elevator 2

:::caution Not recommended
There is currently no tutorial for the Under Elevator 3 route, but it is recommended that you watch the current world record and try to
learn it by watching rather than learning UE2.
:::

Much harder variation of Under Elevator where you have to do all chambers under time pressure to save a minimum amount of time each.
