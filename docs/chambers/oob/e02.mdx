<TabItem value="advanced" label="Advanced" attributes={{className: "advanced"}}>

## VWW Saveglitch

A somewhat precise save glitch route that is faster than the AAG route. VWW can be tricky because of the long loading 
times in e02.

:::tip
Besides being considered as an Advanced strat, it is recommended that you at least try it once before sticking to AAG,
since the difficulty of both strats is very subjective.
