## Save Glitch

Simple route that uses 1 save glitch to put you at the very end of Chamber 03, skipping Chamber 02's elevator.

## Under Elevator + New Game

:::caution Requires video recording
:::
Modified save glitch route to get under the Chamber 03's elevator, finishing the chamber a bit faster than the route above. Uses New Game in
order to avoid being stuck under the elevator. You must record video (showing livesplit and your run) to use this since it requires pausing and you also have to use `sv_unlockedchapters 0` 
every time you reset.

## Under Elevator + Infront

Route that is done under time pressure, but allows you to start Chamber 04 in front of the elevator, saving a small amount of time (is in theory
slower than newgame at Chamber 04, but it's much easier to be faster).

## Under Elevator + Infront and SG preserve

Different ending for the route above, that allows preserving saveglitch to chamber 04. Must be done even faster in order to make it in time
before the elevator finishes going up.
